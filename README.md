# Spidy-the-Bluetooth-Controlled-Arduino-Spider-Robot

It's the arduino Nano used code for a app controlled spider robot.

You can download the STL file above in Spider Model Folder.It is provided with the images of the each part and assembly.We 3D printed these parts.

I have used the following components in this project:<br/>
a) Arduino Nano <br/>
b) Nano 328P Expansion Adapter Breakout Board IO Shield <br/>
c) HC05 Bluetooth Module  <br/>
d) SG90 Mini Servo 12 pieces <br/>
e) Lithium Ion Battery 2 pieces<br/>
f)Battery Holder with DC Jack<br/>
g) Jumper Wires<br/>

To control this using android device, you will need the following app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller.
